This is the home of MobileTerminal.app, a terminal emulator application for the iPhone. MobileTerminal.app is NOT an SSH client, nor Telnet for that matter. It can however be used to execute a console ssh-client application.

See the http://code.google.com/p/mobileterminal/wiki/Roadmap for development plans.
